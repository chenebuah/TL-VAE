# Description
The study develops an inverse design machine learning pipeline by combining a generative Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) model with Target-Learning (TL) feed-forward neural networks to form the TL-VAE perovskite generator. The results report the discovery of promising new perovskite candidates of the ABX<sub>3</sub> generic, which are unique and polymorphic material variants.
